# Grid, a command-line text editor (In Progress)
Command-line text editor in C similar to the like of ’vim’ and ’nano’

## Current progress
* Created the structures necessary to support reading files and displaying them on screen in canonical mode. Implemented a row/columns buffer system.
* Get handle input to be working consistently working on linking editing the files and linking the change to be display on screen live.

*Will soon adopt more features as the project goes on.*

## Resources used
This instruction booklet was where I started with in order to understand what libraries and elements I have to think about.
